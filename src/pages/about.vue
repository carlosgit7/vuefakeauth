            Vue is powerful for creating Single Page Applications: highly
            interactive webpages that don’t refresh when you change from page 
            to page. If your website has multiple pages (or “views”) and you’re 
            using Vue, that’s why you need Vue Router.

        <p>Vue Router is available via <span class="italic font-semibold">npm</span> with the package named <span class="italic font-semibold">vue-router.</span></p>
